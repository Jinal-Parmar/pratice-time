New (instance of thread class)
Runnable (after calling start())
Running (thread scheduler selected it as running thread)
Non-Runnable (Blocked-alive but not eligible to run )
Terminated (dead state-run() exists)


Thread class or Runnable Interface/ isme explict Thread class ka instance bnna pdega
run() directly kiya to same stack me hi call hoga so naormal method jesa treat hoga

The join() method waits for a thread to die. 
it causes the currently running threads to stop executing until the thread it joins
with completes its task.
t1.start t1.join t2.start t3.start.........so t1 pura hoga t2-t3 me context switching

Daemon Thread
It provides services to user threads for background supporting tasks. It has no role
in life than to serve user threads.
Its life depends on user threads.
It is a low priority thread.
daemon thread banai hai to us thread ko badme start() krna hai


Thread pool- better peeformance
a group of fixed size threads are created. A thread from the thread pool 
is pulled out and assigned a job by the service provider.
 After completion of the job, thread is contained in the thread pool again.

ThreadGroup
 group multiple threads in a single object
suspend, resume or interrupt group of threads by a single method call.

shutdown hook can be used to perform cleanup resource or save the state when JVM
shuts down normally or abruptly.

-uses a real-world setting                 -completely virtual
-users can control their                   -users are controlled by the system
presence in the real world;  
-accessed with a smartphone                -requires a headset device,
-enhances both the virtual+real world      -only enhances a fictional reality
